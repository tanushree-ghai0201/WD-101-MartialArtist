This is a web application in which you are the Martial Artist and you are practising your moves. 
You can punch, kick, go forward, backward, and even block your opponent, all using your keyboard keys. 
It's a fun simulation and I made it as a part of the Capstone Project of a course I took up on WEB DEVELOPMENT - 101. under Pupilfirst Schools.
It is built using HTML and JavaScript only. 
Here you can try this on : https://tanushree-ghai0201.github.io/WD-101-MartialArtist/WD%20101/index.html
HAVE FUN!
